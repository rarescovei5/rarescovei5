## 🛠️ Things I'm working on

* **[Commander](https://github.com/rarescovei5/commander)** – Like *commander.js*, but for Rust. A simple library handles user input so you don't have to.
* **[Principium UI](https://github.com/principium-studios/principium-ui)** – A component library that serves as an exploration project to understand not only how component libraries work, but also how large monorepos are structured.
* **[Principium](https://github.com/rarescovei5/Principium)** – Hosts the backend for Principium apps such as the VSC Snippet Extension, as well as the Principium Store, an app for easily downloading Principium apps (similar to the Microsoft Store).
* **[VSC Snippet Extension](https://github.com/rarescovei5/VSC-Snippet-Extension)** – A Visual Studio Code extension that makes managing and discovering snippets easy through an integrated webview directly inside the editor.
* **[jUnity](https://github.com/rarescovei5/jUnity)** – A very minimal game engine written in JavaScript. It supports rendering triangles, squares, and circles, along with collision logic for each shape.
* **[Synclite](https://github.com/rarescovei5/SyncLite)** - A lightweight, rust CLI tool for fast and efficient file synchronization, inspired by Syncthing.
