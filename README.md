## 🛠️ Stuff I built

* **[dsl_cli](https://github.com/rarescovei5/dsl_cli)** – A small proc-macro DSL for defining command-line interfaces in Rust.
* **[Principium UI](https://github.com/principium-studios/principium-ui)** – A component library that serves as an exploration project to understand not only how component libraries work, but also how large monorepos are structured.
* **[VSC Snippet Extension](https://github.com/rarescovei5/VSC-Snippet-Extension)** – A Visual Studio Code extension that makes managing and discovering snippets easy through an integrated webview directly inside the editor.
* **[jUnity](https://github.com/rarescovei5/jUnity)** – A very minimal game engine written in JavaScript. It supports rendering triangles, squares, and circles, along with collision logic for each shape.
* **[Synclite](https://github.com/rarescovei5/SyncLite)** - A lightweight, rust CLI tool for fast and efficient file synchronization, inspired by Syncthing.
